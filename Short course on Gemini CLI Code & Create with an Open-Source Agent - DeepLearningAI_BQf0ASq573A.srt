00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm delighted to introduce this course

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
on Gemini CLI which is built with

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Google's Jack Waters. Gemini CLI

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
especially with the release of the

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Gemini 3 model has become one of my

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
favorite coding tools. It's created many

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
coding tasks including especially

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
front-end design and I find my usage of

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
it increasing. In this course you learn

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
how to use it both for coding and

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
perhaps less obviously some non-coding

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
tasks like organizing images and text on

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
your disc to help with writing tasks. I

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
also appreciate particularly that Gemini

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
CLI is open source. I know quite a few

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
people that have enjoyed looking at the

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
code, reading the prompts that Gemini

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
CLI uses, and really getting to

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
understand how it works.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thanks for having me, Andrew. In this

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
course, you'll learn several useful

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
applications of Gemini CLI as an example

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
for software development, adding new

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
features to an existing website like a

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
conference session catalog, developing a

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
visual dashboard with data from local

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
files and a database, and automating

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
pull request reviews with Gemini CLI and

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
GitHub actions. But Gemini CLI is also

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
incredibly useful for complex use cases

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
beyond coding. You will learn how to

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
develop a full social media kit for an

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
event with Canva templates and nano

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
banana image generation and search

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
through all of your notes and slides

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
from your online courses like this one.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I use Aenti coding assistance all the

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
time for coding, but for non-coding

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
examples as well, I actually use an AI

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
assistant to organize my personal

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
workout plan by manipulating context

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
file within my own file system. And so

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
in this course you learn some best

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
practices for the non-coding tasks as

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
well. Because Frontier OM are so

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
powerful, they can carry out multiple

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
steps autonomously. Gemini CLI is an

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
interface that lets you access the raw

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
reasoning and function calling

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
capabilities of such a model. So after

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
giving the model access to tools like

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
disk access and GitHub and web search

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and maybe some MCP service, you can then

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
instruct the model to perform a highle

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
task like coding an interactive game and

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
let it autonomously plan and execute a

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
complex workflow. You're totally right.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Agentic coding assistants shine when you

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
want to interact with a mix of local

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
tools installed on your computer as well

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
as cloud services like maybe Postman,

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Figma, or Google Docs. This is where

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
using Gemini CLI in your terminal really

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
shines. In one use case in this course,

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
you'll source lead generation data from

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
your local machine and Google Sheets and

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
perform some analysis on it to create a

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
data dashboard. You'll learn all about

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
best practices and managing Gemini CLI

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to complete these types of multi-tool

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
workflows. Everyone can be an AI builder

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and I hope many people including

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
software developers but also people in

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
other job roles will be able to use

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
agentic assistance like Gemini CI to

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
carry out both coding and non-coding

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
tasks.
